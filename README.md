# CyberpunkRifle
A small Arduino project to animate 2 x LED strips down the side of a 3D printed Prop Cyberpunk rifle.

Uses an Adafruit Trinket M0, although any Arduino should do the job.  Strip animation settings are stored in the controller flash for the next power on.

Mode button changes both the power on mode and the trigger mode - to change trigger mode, hold down trigger button and press mode.
